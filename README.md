This is an insight project where a data base from house sales in the King County (USA) was used to generate insights to help the CEO on making decisions about buying and selling properties. The *kc_house_data* can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). 

Here, you can find the final dashboard for this project: [House Rocket App](https://house-rocket-insightapp.herokuapp.com/)

# Business question

We have two main questions:

1. What are the real states House Rocket should buy, and how much will it cost?
2. What is the best moment to sell the real states, and how much will it cost? 
    
# Business assumptions 

# Solution Planning

- New houses are not substantially more expensive than old houses, on average. 
- Houses without basement are 22.56% bigger in total area than houses with basement.
- Waterfront houses are 212.64% more expensive, on average.

- Explore the possibility to renovate the house and sell them.
